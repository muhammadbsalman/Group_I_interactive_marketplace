# Interactive Marketplace
A marketplace is a platform for the vendors to sell their products to the customers. This acts as an exceptional multi-purpose stage for sellers and customers to buy and sell various products at a single
destination. Therefore, our task is to develop a software where multiple vendors can come together and sell
different kinds of products to a wide range of customers using highly popular software programming
language, C. Our software must address all the needs of both the sellers and buyers for it to be efficient.
